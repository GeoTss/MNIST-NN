# MNIST-NN

A Neural Network that has 2 hidden layers written completly in C++ from scratch using the Eigen library for fast matrix operations. The information for the trained model (weights, biases with dimensions for each) is stored in trained_model/model.bin after each training session. I do this in order to use the prediction functionality without having to train the model each time. It also contains a python script for seeing the model in action, visualising the prefered test and prediction.
